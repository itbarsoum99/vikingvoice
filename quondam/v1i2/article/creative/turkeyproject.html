<p>[OLD-TIMEY SCHOOL BELL RINGS]</p>
<p>[MUSIC PLAYS]</p>
<p><em>Students go to class. Some of them.</em></p>
<p><em>The scene cuts to the cramped math classroom, where students enter gradually. Indu and Irwin stand next to a large whiteboard.</em></p>
<p><strong>Indu: </strong>What should the IB word of the day be?</p>
<p><strong>Irwin</strong>: Rechtsschutzversicherungsgesellschaften.</p>
<p><strong>Indu: </strong><em>What??</em></p>
<p><strong>Irwin: </strong>Rechtsschutzversicherungsgesellschaften. It means &ldquo;insurance companies who provide legal protection.&rdquo;</p>
<p><strong>Indu: </strong>Yes, I know that <em>(rolls eyes)</em>. I didn&rsquo;t expect <em>you</em> to.</p>
<p><strong>Indu, monologue: </strong>He was an insufferable know-it-all. But Irwin and I had still become fast friends in the early weeks of the school year. Or at least that&rsquo;s what he thinks. Me? I just scored myself a free math tutor.</p>
<p><strong>Irwin: </strong>I can <em>still</em> hear you.</p>
<p><em>Indu writes the word on the whiteboard, while Mr. Schafer enters silently.</em></p>
<p><strong>Indu: </strong>Rekt-shucks-Versace-rung-shell-shaft. I like that.</p>
<p><strong>Mr. Schafer: </strong><em>What</em> did you just say? We speak German in Austria, but that sounded like a Slavic language. Or Austroasiatic. Or Tupian. Or <em>anything</em> except a nice, respectable Germanic language.</p>
<p><strong>Indu: </strong>Rekt-</p>
<p><strong>Mr. Schafer: </strong>Rechtsschutzversicherungsgesellschaften?</p>
<p><strong>Indu:</strong> Ugh, yes.</p>
<p><strong>Irwin: </strong>It&rsquo;s not that hard to pronounce.</p>
<p><strong>Indu: </strong>Then you do it, if you&rsquo;re so talented.</p>
<p><strong>Irwin: </strong>[makes sound like a cat choking up a furball]</p>
<p><strong>Mr. Schafer: </strong>You all are so useless.</p>
<hr/>
<p><em>Halloween was fast-approaching, and North Mellinger was preparing in the only way it knew how to: by doing absolutely nothing. Despite this, the students were in the mood for pumpkin pie. Mr. Schafer, meanwhile, intends to teach pre-calculus.</em></p>
<p><strong>Irwin: </strong>I need some pie.</p>
<p><strong>Indu: </strong>I know, right?&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Mr. Schafer: </strong>I&rsquo;ll buy you both pie if you can recite the first fifty digits of pi and then just <em>shut up</em>.</p>
<p><strong>Irwin: </strong>Okay! 3.14159265359&hellip;</p>
<p><strong>Indu, monologue: </strong>Irwin had a tendency to take things too far. Like now. See how he&rsquo;s still reciting those digits in the cinematically blurred background of this shot? Anyways, let&rsquo;s get back to the captivating footage.</p>
<p><strong>Irwin: </strong>&hellip;97169399375. Done!</p>
<p><strong>Mr. Schafer: </strong>That was only 49 digits. Now will you <em>please</em> let me continue the lesson?</p>
<p><strong>Irwin: </strong>There&rsquo;s no way!&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>Irwin begins counting the digits of pi that he recited, as Mr. Schafer continues.</em></p>
<p><strong>Mr. Schafer: </strong>Okay, now it&rsquo;s that time of year for me to finally introduce my favorite project.</p>
<p><strong>Indu: </strong>Oh no. This is when you take your bags and run.</p>
<p><strong>Mr. Schafer: </strong>It's called the Turkey Project. Here&rsquo;s the rubric, y'all can read.</p>
<p><em>Mr. Schafer passes out a paper to each student.</em></p>
<p><strong>Irwin: </strong>What are these criteria? <em>Colorful breast feathers depicting the unit circle?</em></p>
<p><strong>Rekha: </strong><em>Feathers with all the information from all of trigonometry?</em></p>
<p><strong>Indu, laughing: </strong>Y&rsquo;all haven&rsquo;t even read the line where it says <em>the turkey must be alive.</em></p>
<p><em>Irwin nods as if unsurprised. Rekha&rsquo;s face goes pale.</em></p>
<p><strong>Rekha: </strong>I can&rsquo;t do this, I&rsquo;m terrified of flightless birds.</p>
<p><strong>Indu:</strong> Flightless? What about the rest of them?</p>
<p><strong>Rekha: </strong>Have you ever seen Big Bird? Literally Schafer.</p>
<p><strong>Irwin:</strong> She has a point.</p>
<p><strong>Rekha:</strong> I am a woman of science, and science includes biology&mdash;</p>
<p><strong>Irwin:</strong> Barely.</p>
<p><strong>Rekha:</strong> And according to biology, evolution is real&mdash;</p>
<p><strong>Mr. Schafer:</strong> Evolution is fake, it&rsquo;s all a conspiracy.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Rekha: </strong>Birds have wings, why? To fly. What can flightless birds not do?</p>
<p><strong>Indu:</strong> Fly?</p>
<p><strong>Rekha:</strong> So why the <em>wings</em>?</p>
<p><strong>Mr. Schafer: </strong>Are you done with your <em>nonsense</em>? Your project is due in a month.</p>
<p><strong>Irwin: </strong>A month?? I haven&rsquo;t seen a real-life turkey in years!</p>
<p><strong>Indu: </strong>Wasn&rsquo;t a turkey spotted at North a few years back?</p>
<p><strong>Irwin: </strong>No, that was probably just Schafer.</p>
<p><strong>Rekha: </strong>I haven&rsquo;t seen one in seven months, thirteen days, four hours, and fifty-seven minutes.</p>
<p><strong>Indu: </strong>That is&hellip; incredibly specific.</p>
<p><strong>Rekha: </strong>You would remember if a monstrous, flightless beast made an ungodly sound in your direction.</p>
<p><strong>Mr. Schafer:</strong> Gobble gooble!</p>
<p><em>Rekha takes her bags and runs.</em></p>
<p><strong>Indu:</strong> You know, I&rsquo;m starting to think she&rsquo;s the smartest one here.</p>
<p><strong>Mr. Schafer:</strong> You&rsquo;re all disappointments until you <em>BRING ME A TURKEY!</em></p>
<hr/>
<p><em>The episode cuts to an open field, where tall grasses shimmer in the wind.</em> &ldquo;America the Beautiful&rdquo; <em>starts playing.</em></p>
<p><em>The camera pans up to a drone view of the field. Suddenly, something disrupts the wheat fields with a loud crash.</em></p>
<p><strong>Indu: </strong>Get it!!!</p>
<p><em>A high-speed chase ensues; one entity is a blur through the golden grasses. The others, a group of five exhausted teenagers, persist anyways.</em></p>
<p><strong>Griffin, calling out: </strong>Indu, we&rsquo;ve been chasing this thing for so long! Shouldn&rsquo;t we give up already?</p>
<p><strong>Indu: </strong>It&rsquo;s been forty-eight seconds, and you&rsquo;re already ready to disappoint Mr. Schafer? Never. Keep running!</p>
<p><strong>Aurora: </strong>I should have stayed behind with Rekha.</p>
<p><em>The group emerges from the abyss</em>. <em>In an open clearing, they stand in a superhero-like formation. </em>&ldquo;Eye of the Tiger&rdquo; <em>plays from Indu&rsquo;s phone, the source of the earlier music. Rekha is inexplicably present in this clearing.</em></p>
<p><strong>Indu: </strong>Rekha, how are you here?</p>
<p><strong>Rekha: </strong>Oh, I just ran around the field.</p>
<p><strong>Aurora: </strong>You ran <em>around</em> it? I was considering turning around in the middle.</p>
<p><em>The camera cuts between zoomed-in shots of each character&rsquo;s face. As the close-ups progress, the characters&rsquo; faces become more and more concerned as a look of realization dawns upon them.</em></p>
<p><strong>Irwin: </strong>Rekha, you haven&rsquo;t seen a turkey, have you?</p>
<p><strong>Rekha: </strong>No! Need I remind you? Flightless bird, Irwin, flightless bird!</p>
<p><strong>Indu, carefully: </strong>Rekha, don&rsquo;t move.</p>
<p><em>Zayn and Griffin lunge towards her simultaneously. Rekha jumps up, and realizes she&rsquo;s sitting on the turkey. She screams as the others jump at the turkey, which evades their grasp and jumps into her arms. She screams. The turkey screams. Everyone screams.</em></p>
<p><strong>Rekha: </strong>Get this thing away from me!</p>
<p><em>Rekha throws the turkey in Indu&rsquo;s direction. Indu catches it, a victorious glint in her eyes.</em></p>
<p><strong>Indu: </strong>Ha! I win, losers. Good luck finding <em>your </em>turkeys.</p>
<p><strong>Irwin: </strong>You thought I came unprepared for this?</p>
<p><em>Irwin removes a bag of dried corn from a satchel bag. Indu&rsquo;s face belies surprise.</em></p>
<p><strong>Irwin: </strong>Here, turkey turkey. Come to mam&aacute;.</p>
<p><em>The turkey kicks itself out of Indu&rsquo;s arms and trots up to Irwin.</em></p>
<p><strong>Indu: </strong>You had those the <em>whole</em> time and you&rsquo;re just now getting them out? Where was the delicious corn when we were running through that giant field?&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Irwin: </strong>I had to keep it safe for a moment like this. This way, I don&rsquo;t have to buy a frozen turkey from the store like I was planning to. Thanks, Indu! See y&rsquo;all on Monday.</p>
<p><em>Indu fumes as the episode cuts back to the classroom.</em></p>
<hr/>
<p><em>Everyone has gathered inside Schafer&rsquo;s small classroom, wrangling their turkeys and waiting for Schafer to enter so a winning turkey can be chosen.</em></p>
<p><strong>Mr. Schafer:</strong> Class, meet your judges! First, we have my daughters, Ivanka and Adele&hellip;</p>
<p><strong>Ivanka:</strong> *waves*</p>
<p><strong>Adele:</strong> Good morning, competitors.</p>
<p><strong>Indu:</strong> It was like staring at a shorter, blonder, and much more feminine Schafer.</p>
<p><strong>Mr. Schafer:</strong> Mr. Booker&hellip;</p>
<p><strong>Mr. Booker:</strong> Schafer, you said there was going to be pie. I guess pie is only good for dividing things by.</p>
<p><strong>Mr. Paschen:</strong> He also said we were going to be done by 8:30 but right now it&rsquo;s almost *checks watch* 8:47.</p>
<p><strong>Mr. Schafer:</strong> Or as I like to say, 7:107! And yes, Mr. Paschen is here as well! While you&rsquo;re waiting, Mr. Paschen, why don&rsquo;t you ponder the idea that time is socially constructed? (<em>Paschen breaks.</em>) Now, for our final and most esteemed guest, please welcome&hellip;</p>
<p><strong>Irwin:</strong> Is it Gordon Ramsay? Please, please, <em>please</em> let it be Gordon Ramsay.</p>
<p><strong>Mr. Schafer:</strong> All the way from Austria&hellip;</p>
<p><strong>Indu</strong>: Twenty bucks says it&rsquo;s gonna be a von Trapp.</p>
<p><strong>Mr. Schafer:</strong> &hellip;my grandmother!</p>
<p><strong>Zayn:</strong> Oh, shiitake mushrooms. *laughs* We&rsquo;re so scr&mdash;</p>
<p><strong>Irwin: </strong>Indu, you owe me $20.</p>
<p><em>Grandma Schafer, an ancient, stooped old woman hobbles to the center of the room. She takes a deep breath, and&hellip;</em></p>
<p><strong>Grandma Schafer:</strong> Let the feast&hellip; BEGIN!</p>
<p><em>The scene cuts to the very end, where two final turkeys remain. Schafer&rsquo;s daughters have joined the eliminated students in eating pie. So has Mr. Booker. It appears that Mr. Paschen has, out of boredom, invented a new paradox to teach his students about. Schafer and his grandmother scrutinize the birds before making their choice.</em></p>
<p><strong>Mr. Schafer:</strong> Well, what do we think?</p>
<p><strong>Grandma Schafer:</strong> This one. Strong, healthy, colorful, and with neat handwriting.</p>
<p><strong>Irwin:</strong> In. Your. <em>FACE</em>.</p>
<p><strong>Indu:</strong> Hey hey <em>HEY</em>. That was my turkey before you bribed it with corn!</p>
<p><strong>Irwin:</strong> All&rsquo;s fair in love and turkey bribing, Indu.</p>
<p><strong>Indu:</strong> You never would have caught it if I hadn&rsquo;t thought of the sleeping pill raisins!</p>
<p><strong>Irwin:</strong> You got that from a book and you know it!</p>
<p><strong>Indu:</strong> You were about to buy a frozen turkey from the store, Irwin! From the <em>store</em>!</p>
<p><strong>Irwin, gesturing angrily to the rubric:</strong> It&rsquo;s not against any rules!&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Mr. Schafer:</strong> I&rsquo;m going to quote Indu and say &lsquo;you haven&rsquo;t even read the line where it says the turkey must be <em>alive.</em>&rsquo;</p>
<p><em>The winning turkey has become clearly agitated, puffing and preening his feathers. A storm is brewing. Then, without warning, it leaps towards Grandma Schafer as the teachers struggle to contain it. Rekha has fainted.</em></p>
<p><strong>Grandma Schafer:</strong> A spitfire! We made the right choice! This one will be exceptionally tasty, won&rsquo;t it, Arnold?</p>
<p><strong>Aurora:</strong> I&rsquo;m sorry, tasty?</p>
<p><strong>Mr. Schafer:</strong> Did I not tell you all? The winning turkey will be prepared for Thanksgiving dinner at my house, and the winner is cordially invited to join!</p>
<p><strong>Indu, patting Irwin on the back:</strong> Have fun, dude.</p>
<p><strong>Irwin:</strong> You know, Indu, I was wrong. This turkey? It&rsquo;s rightfully yours, and I was a fool to try and argue otherwise.</p>
<p><strong>Indu:</strong> No, no, you were right. All&rsquo;s fair in love and turkey poaching.</p>
<p><strong>Irwin:</strong> Bribing. And please, I insist.</p>
<p><strong>Mr. Schafer:</strong> Hold on. Are you trying to get <em>out</em> of going to dinner?</p>
<p><strong>Irwin:</strong> Absolutely not!</p>
<p><strong>Everyone else:</strong> Uh, yeah.</p>
<p><strong>Mr. Schafer:</strong> Well, since you&rsquo;re all <em>so</em> enthusiastic about this, I&rsquo;ve decided to extend this mandatory invitation to everyone. I&rsquo;ll see you in a week!</p>
<p><strong>Indu:</strong> I&rsquo;m afraid you won&rsquo;t. Are you familiar with the Geneva Conventions?</p>
<p><strong>Mr. Schafer:</strong> Well of <em>course</em>. I was there when they were signed.</p>
<p><strong>Irwin: </strong>In 1949?</p>
<p><strong>Mr. Schafer: </strong>Yes, of course.</p>
<p><strong>Indu:</strong> Well, according to Articles 33 and 87&mdash;</p>
<p><strong>Irwin:</strong> &mdash;Collective punishment is a war crime! And if you&rsquo;re considering this punishment, and you&rsquo;re doling it out to everyone, then that makes you guilty of committing a war crime.</p>
<p><strong>Mr. Schafer:</strong> Tell me something I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p><strong>Grandma Schafer:</strong> I eat war crimes for breakfast.</p>
<p><strong>Mr. Schafer, affectionately: </strong>I learned it all from you, Grandma.</p>
<hr/>
<p><em>The class returns after Thanksgiving, having witnessed the atrocities of a Schafer family dinner.</em></p>
<p><strong>Indu: </strong>That was crazy, how he just ate the green bean like that.</p>
<p><strong>Irwin:</strong> That was nothing. You saw how that cousin ate their mashed potatoes, right?</p>
<p><strong>Zayn:</strong> It was their fault for making it so it could even be consumed with a straw. I mean, come on.</p>
<p><strong>Griffin: </strong>Nothing compares to how the dog absolutely devoured that sweet potato casserole. Since when do dogs like marshmallows?</p>
<p><strong>Aurora:</strong> I thought it was sweet, they were all so close-knit. I wish I had something a little like that.</p>
<p><em>Everyone chimes in, nodding and murmuring in agreement.</em></p>
<p><strong>Rekha:</strong> You know what guys? Shame on you. Shame on you for thinking that we don&rsquo;t. Look around. Is this not the same thing? Zayn, you&rsquo;re our effortlessly cool cousin. Aurora, you&rsquo;re the sweetheart, the glue that keeps us together. Griffin, you&rsquo;re probably the most normal one out of all of us, which is really saying something. Indu, you&rsquo;re the aunt who only visits on holidays, but only because she&rsquo;s so busy travelling and collecting cool stories to tell when you get back. Irwin, you&rsquo;re like the child prodigy, but less, you know, prodigious.</p>
<p><strong>Irwin: </strong>Wow, thanks.</p>
<p><strong>Rekha:</strong> All together, we&rsquo;re a family. We&rsquo;ve got everything they have, maybe even better. And to think that we needed a turkey (<em>shudders</em>) to figure that out. So, happy Thanksgiving.</p>
<p><strong>Indu:</strong> Gobble gooble.</p>
<p><em>Rekha screams, taking her bag and running away. The lights go down on the scene.</em></p>

    <p>The North Meck women&rsquo;s varsity volleyball team went undefeated for the first five games of their 2022 season. This astonishing start to the season brought special attention to the team, and exceptional support from the community of student-athletes at the school. Their first loss against Highland School of Technology on August 29th, however, did not end the support from other student-athletes, especially the men&rsquo;s soccer team. Finishing with a winning record (12-10), the team had a successful season filled with ups, downs, and endless support from the North Mecklenburg community.</p>
<p>Dominique Moore, a senior defensive specialist, gives us more information on just how impactful the 2022 season was.&nbsp;</p>
<div class="no-indent">
<p><strong>How would you describe the team community this year?</strong></p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe balanced in the way that there weren&rsquo;t any dominating people that tried to run everything without considering everybody [else]. I also felt like we mostly got along pretty well.&rdquo;</p>
<p><strong>What do you think was key in the team&rsquo;s success?&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>&ldquo;I think it was the bonds we had and how we would hype and try to encourage each other when we could.&rdquo;</p>
<p><strong>Being a senior, how did your final game of the season feel?&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>&ldquo;Our final game was against Hough, so I feel like that can say enough itself. But I know I was mentally and physically prepared and, looking back on what was happening during the game and afterwards, I can&rsquo;t say [that] I think some of my teammates were [also]. I was happy with my performance, but I still do think we could&rsquo;ve played better as a whole. So just, overall, it wasn&rsquo;t our best game, but I think it was still a good one.&rdquo;</p>
<p><strong>What could the team improve on in future seasons?</strong></p>
<p>&ldquo;Consistency in their skill sets, whether it is passing, hitting, serving, or setting. And also gaining trust while on the court. There will be bonds, of course, but I feel like that doesn&rsquo;t always mean you can completely trust one another.&rdquo;</p>
<p><strong>How do you feel about the support you received from team parents and coaches this year? What did they succeed on and/or what improvements do you feel should be made?</strong></p>
<p>&ldquo;I really enjoyed the support I felt from the team parents, especially considering they helped out with planning and decorating for my senior night; I really appreciated them for that. I felt that the coaches were very supportive and encouraging as well, especially the new JV coach we got. Even though I was not her player, she still cheered [me on] and advised me, which made me feel good and encouraged me to do better.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>

<p>The 2022 women&rsquo;s volleyball season was exciting to watch unfold, and the 2023 season has potential to be the best yet, with many talented players working to improve during the off-season. With the start of the men&rsquo;s season following the success of the women&rsquo;s, the fast-paced sport of volleyball is thriving at North Mecklenburg High School. ðŸ†… </p>

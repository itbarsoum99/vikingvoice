    <p>If you were to enter the North Mecklenburg Orchestra room during any given class period, you would hear and see several different things. Instrumentalists add rosin to their bows, students turn to their stand partners and ask questions about a piece of music, some players clap to a section to master the rhythm, and more. But there is one thing that would be difficult to be aware of at first sight: the orchestra community. Through the rehearsal of pieces and the development of music skills, students become a part of a bigger community and receive heartwarming support from their fellow students, many of whom they might not have even met if it weren&rsquo;t for orchestra class.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The cultivator of this incredible community is Mr. Stephen Taperek, who ran the orchestra department at North Mecklenburg High School for over six years. On Monday, September 11th, 2023, he announced to his Symphonic Orchestra class that he would be moving on from teaching at the end of the month.</p>
<p>In an interview for the <em>Viking Voice</em>, Mr. Taperek explained that what he would miss most about teaching was the relationships that he was able to build with his coworkers and students. For him, teaching was not just about the results, but also about the orchestra community itself. In regards to the arts program as a whole, he appreciated that there was a &ldquo;really good core of arts students that all interacted with each other.&rdquo; He mentioned that, in the arts department, &ldquo;it seemed that everyone knew each other no matter what class they were in, and it felt like it was a very special place to be.&rdquo;</p>
<p>While he enjoyed much of his time as a teacher, Mr. Taperek did face certain struggles while teaching, one of which was communication with students and parents. When there was clear communication, class activities and performances went more smoothly than when there wasn&rsquo;t. Other issues that he faced were &ldquo;normal things that teachers struggle with,&rdquo; such as getting supplies, for example. In orchestra especially, supplies are expensive, which led to some issues with providing these resources to students in the classroom.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Despite these roadblocks, Mr. Taperek feels that music is still important for education. &ldquo;Odds are, very few students are going to be music majors [...], but for a lot of students, it is a place for them to come and enjoy,&rdquo; he explained. While there are still expectations for the students, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s a chance for everyone to relax a little bit, have fun, be themselves, [and] enjoy themselves.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
<p>While he is not teaching anymore, he still hopes that his students succeed in the future. &ldquo;Whether they&rsquo;re seniors about to go to college, going to the workforce or military&hellip; or if they have a few more years in high school, [I hope they] make decisions that are going to make [themselves] happy,&rdquo; he explained. A piece of advice that he shared was to &ldquo;Just enjoy your time because it does go by really fast.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Even when he was not feeling his best, he made sure his students were. Beyond being an excellent teacher, he provided continuous support for his students and created a classroom environment in which everyone felt safe and understood.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The new orchestra teacher, Ms. Bouman, has taken over Mr. Taperek&rsquo;s role as orchestra director. She was selected by Mr. Taperek himself and is well-liked by her new students. When Mr. Taperek was asked what advice he would give the new teacher, he suggested that she show up as herself and teach the way that she feels is best. He explained that, when he first started teaching, he found himself trying to replicate the teaching styles of other educators. He found that having his own teaching style was most beneficial for both himself and his students.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;Despite his remorse for leaving this job and his students, Mr. Taperek is excited to embark on this new chapter of his life. Mr. Taperek&rsquo;s work at North Mecklenburg High School was remarkable, to say the least. His students and North Mecklenburg High School are incredibly grateful for all the effort he put into making the orchestra department as successful as it is and wish him the best of luck in the future. ðŸ†…</p>

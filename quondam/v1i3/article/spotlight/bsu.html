    <p>On March 1st, the Black Student Union (BSU) hosted their first &ldquo;Paint and Sip,&rdquo; which was a major success! A paint and sip is exactly what it sounds like: you sip a beverage while painting a picture. At the event, the students were able to engage with others while creatively expressing themselves through painting. BSU is a fairly new student organization that started in the fall semester of this school year. Previously, they held a game night in November.</p>
<p>Here are a few words from Kamryn, a junior who attended the event. She responded:&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>What elements of the event did you enjoy most?</strong></p>
<p>I liked that I was able to meet new people, I felt comfortable around the people I was with and being able to paint and express my creativity on the canvas!</p>
<p><strong>Are you likely to participate in one of BSU&rsquo;s events in the future?</strong></p>
<p>Yes, I would love to participate in another paint and sip or maybe become a member of the student union.</p>
<p><strong>What type of events would you like to see in the future?</strong></p>
<p>I would love to see the club host a movie night!</p>
<p><strong>How did you hear about this event?</strong></p>
<p>I heard about this event from friends that are members of the club.</p>

    <h2 class="nmbe">Rebuild CMS, The Right Way</h2>

    <p>Charlotte-Mecklenburg Schools has introduced a new plan to build and replace schools across the county, North Mecklenburg included. This $2.9 billion bond focuses on rebuilding existing schools and will lead to changes in magnet programs, grade level distinctions, and boundaries. The priority of this plan is to better conditions that prevent healthy learning environments. Pausing lessons to deal with bug infestations and trying to focus on high classroom temperatures is a daily struggle for many students and teachers across the county. So, what is CMS doing to change this, and how can we ensure this change will be worthwhile?</p>
<p>Remaking CMS seems like an extreme undertaking, but there are many reasons to support new school facilities. Classroom temperature, noise levels, and the number of students present can affect how individuals, students and teachers alike, focus and perform. Doing well on exams, essays, or even simple class assignments is challenging when you&rsquo;re distracted by the temperature. Additionally, poor conditions in schools diminish teacher performance. According to a 1998 study by Christella Dawson and Randall J. Parker, teachers had lower frustration levels and higher morale after their schools were renovated.</p>
<p>At North Meck specifically, our facilities need desperate attention. From dead mice in A Hall to holes in the floor of the boys&rsquo; bathroom in the mobiles, there are issues in our facilities that this bond would help immensely. If these issues are addressed, North Meck students will have a much better educational experience, and our teachers will be more satisfied with their jobs.</p>
<p>On February 28th, the CMS school board voted to approve the bond. The opinions of most board members were unanimous: they want improved facilities for students. Board member Thelma Byers-Bailey said, &ldquo;The school that these students come to on a daily basis speaks volumes to whether or not we really care about them.&rdquo; The importance of well-maintained school facilities is often overlooked. But if students are the future, we deserve to attend school buildings that will enhance our education, not lessen its quality. Board members like Ms. Byers-Bailey are pushing for a long overdue change in our school system that will help in achieving the goal of school buildings that support students&rsquo; education.</p>
<p>However, looking at our school specifically, a certain sentimentality needs to be taken into account when reflecting on how this new bond will impact where we receive our education. English teacher and alumnus Ms. Soesbee spoke with us regarding her perspective on the sentiments behind the age of our school buildings. She says, &ldquo;because this was the school that served the entire northern end of the county for so long, a lot of people are still here in the area attached to the school. When you have an old town like Huntersville, it&rsquo;s special to still have some of the old buildings.&rdquo; However, sentimentality alone does not outweigh the quality of a student&rsquo;s education. Ms. Soesbee emphasizes that &ldquo;[she] understands that some money is earmarked for certain things, but [she] would not like to see new facilities built when we&rsquo;re suffering teacher shortages and security issues.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
<p>It is abundantly clear that our school and others across the county need this bond desperately. Studies have shown that better school facilities stimulate better learning and performance for students and teachers alike. It is crucial, though, to keep those making these decisions accountable and be wary of the decisions that would affect our learning environment. However, it is clear that something is being done to improve our education, and this bond is a step in the right direction. ðŸ†…</p>

    <p>Do you remember?&nbsp;</p>
<p>When we were happy and so in love we couldn&rsquo;t think. Drunk without alcohol. You were the only drug I needed. I&rsquo;m still sometimes captivated by your beauty in the same way I was then.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Like an angel, I worshiped your presence.&nbsp;</p>
<p>You were perfect. Or at least as perfect as a person could get. Your laughter was song and I felt lightning bolts on my skin whenever you&rsquo;d look at me. Perfection is hard to obtain, but you were so close. As far as I was concerned, you had achieved it with your crocheted sweaters and terrible dad jokes.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Like humans, our emotions overflowed.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The tears streaming down your face were a physical representation of the pain we were feeling. Our time was running out. We both were aware, but didn&rsquo;t want to accept it. Trying to fix bullet wounds in our hearts with flimsy bandages. Turns out, talking to one another is no use when the situation is helpless at its core.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Like a demon, you now haunt my present.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>I see you in everything I do. I can&rsquo;t even walk down the street without thinking of all the memories that we made together. And I now have to live with the fact that all we ever will be is just that: a memory. A blip in time full of emotions too grand for us to ever comprehend.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Just know that I loved you in the purest sense of the word. At one point, you were my entire world, and my universe will now never be the same.&nbsp;</p>
<p>You have forgotten.&nbsp;</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve moved on to better galaxies.&nbsp;</p>
<p>But, like a ghost, I still remember.&nbsp;</p>

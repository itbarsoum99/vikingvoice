<p>The midterm elections last November brought an overhaul in CMS, which welcomed five new members to its nine-member Board of Education in January.</p>
<p>In District 1, which includes North Mecklenburg, challenger Melissa Easley bested incumbent board member Rhonda Cheek by a small margin. Meanwhile, only Thelma Byers-Bailey in District 2 (West Charlotte) managed to hold onto her seat.</p>
<p>Ms. Easley is a former CMS teacher who ran on a platform that prioritized culture, safety, and achievement. In a comment for the <em>Viking Voice</em>, she explained that the issues most important to her as a board member beginning her tenure are &ldquo;repairing relationships with our teachers, staff, and the community,&rdquo; as well as &ldquo;making sure our teachers have what they need to&hellip;deliver the best instruction possible for our students.&rdquo; Other important priorities include ensuring that students feel safe and supporting high academic achievement.</p>
<p>Ms. Easley resigned from her job in 2020, fearing returning to the classroom at the height of the COVID-19 pandemic. Safety, both physical and emotional, remains a priority for her, although the COVID threat continues to fade. In her statement, she said that &ldquo;CMS has made strides&rdquo; in protecting students physically, through body scanners, safety screenings, and the &ldquo;See Something, Say Something&rdquo; anonymous reporting system.</p>
<p>She emphasized the importance of keeping students &ldquo;free from bullying, bigotry and racism.&rdquo; On the board, she promises to &ldquo;make policies that are inclusive [and] equitable for all students and their families.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Also joining the board was its new student advisor, who is a non-voting member elected by CMS students to provide a voice for students in policy decisions. Butler High School junior Laksha Ramkumar was elected by students to take the place of outgoing advisor Juan Torres Mu&ntilde;oz, of East Mecklenburg. Ms. Ramkumar now represents more than 141,000 students in more than 181 schools from across the district.</p>
<p>In her official profile as a candidate, Ms. Ramkumar wrote that her priority is &ldquo;creating effective and sustainable pathways for students to accomplish their goals.&rdquo; She wants to make sure that &ldquo;CMS leadership [improves its] appeal towards students and [thinks] in the minds of the students&rdquo; when making decisions.</p>
<p>Ms. Ramkumar has advocated for policies like reforming the attendance policy, building a specialized STEM school, installing sanitary product dispensers for girls in high school bathrooms, extending student lunch periods, improving access to college application resources, and changing the dress code to improve its fairness for young women.</p>
<p>Additionally, she promises to expand the opportunities for success by &ldquo;involving [more] students when asking for their opinion on&hellip;issues, diversifying the scope of partners, and pushing for accessibility in underprivileged communities.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ms. Ramkumar defeated seven other candidates for the role in the election amongst students, which concluded on Nov. 8.</p>
<p>In the Board of Education&rsquo;s first regularly-scheduled meeting this term, held on Jan. 10, Ms. Easley highlighted Hopewell High School&rsquo;s band for its performance at the Chick-fil-A Peach Bowl on Dec. 31, stressing the importance of funding for arts programs and emphasizing how the community came together to fund the experience for Hopewell students.</p>
<p>At the same board meeting, Ms. Ramkumar introduced herself as someone &ldquo;really engaged with educational and student advocacy.&rdquo; She spotlighted several of her top priorities as a member of the board in her report.</p>
<p>As the year moves forward, the Board of Education aims to vote by Feb. 28 on a record-shattering $2.9 billion bond package that would direct $202 million towards replacing older buildings and athletic facilities at North Mecklenburg. (This sum would constitute more funding than any other individual project in the district, certainly welcome news for the administration of the aging school.) After passing the board, the plan would be put to voters this November.</p>
<p>The new year brings new perspectives to CMS, driven by an array of new members on the Board of Education. Time will tell what difference it makes.&nbsp; ðŸ†… </p>

    <p>Five girls, round and round,</p>
<p>Spinning at the playground!</p>
<p>Come on, don't fall down,</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s spin round and round!</p>
<br/>
<p>Emily&rsquo;s the oldest!</p>
<p>She&rsquo;s round and she&rsquo;s the boldest!</p>
<p>Her mother loves her very much!</p>
<p>She loved her very much!</p><br/>
<p>Emily&rsquo;s the past tense!</p>
<p>She didn&rsquo;t practice defense!</p>
<p>A man saw her walking to school</p>
<p>And took her far away!</p></br>
<p>Four girls, round and round,</p>
<p>Spinning at the playground!</p>
<p>Come on, don&rsquo;t fall down,</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s spin round and round!</p><br/>
<p>Theresa has an old name!</p>
<p>But her family has lots of fame!</p>
<p>She&rsquo;s pretty and she&rsquo;s very nice!</p>
<p>But now she has no life!</p></br>
<p>A boy asked her to homecoming,</p>
<p>But she said no, it caused a stink!</p>
<p>He walked into her classroom</p>
<p>And shot her at point blank!</p></br>
<p>Three girls, round and round,</p>
<p>Spinning at the playground!</p>
<p>Come on, don&rsquo;t fall down,</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s spin round and round!</p></br>
<p>Annalise and Beatrice!</p>
<p>Pretty twins with pretty names!</p>
<p>But only one got all the love,</p>
<p>so both of them are doves!</p></br>
<p>The pretty girls had a fight,</p>
<p>Beatrice went and grabbed a knife!</p>
<p>She stabbed and stabbed and stabbed and stabbed,</p>
<p>and took both of their lives!</p></br>
<p>One girl, round and round,</p>
<p>Spinning at the playground!</p>
<p>Come on, don&rsquo;t fall down,</p>
<p>She'll spin round and round!</p></br>
<p>Amy was the lucky one,</p>
<p>And her troubles had just begun!</p>
<p>Little Amy was alive,</p>
<p>But she was dead inside!</p></br>
<p>Thirty silly years have passed,</p>
<p>So now&rsquo;s the perfect time...</p>
<p>She&rsquo;s the only one that&rsquo;s left,</p>
<p>And she is writing this rhyme!</p>

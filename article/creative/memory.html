    <p>one minute was all it took</p>
<p>he grabbed me</p>
<p>it happened so quickly I can't remember what he said</p>
<p>his friends laughing like he just cracked a joke</p>
<p>dozens of people around me and nobody said a word</p>
<p>not one person asked 'are you ok?'</p>
<p>fighting back tears as we left the classroom to go to recess</p>
<p>pretending as if nothing happened</p>
<p>having to see him almost every day as if nothing happened</p>
<p>terrified that he would do it again&nbsp;</p><br/>
<p>memories of that day echo in my head&nbsp;</p>
<p>wondering how it all would've gone down if I had the courage to speak up&nbsp;</p>
<p>to tell someone what had happened</p>
<p>what if he did it to someone else</p>
<p>did my silence allow him to go without any consequences for his actions</p>
<p>could breaking it have gotten him what he deserved</p>
<p>I will always wonder about what would have happened</p>
<p>but will I be able to stop worrying about something like this happening again?</p>
<p>when?</p>

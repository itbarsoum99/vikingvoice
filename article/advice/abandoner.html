<p class="disclaim">Dear Andromeda,</p>

<p>I left North Meck last year to go to a different school, and most of my friends are still at North. I’m struggling to talk to new people and make friends because it feels like I’m replacing all the old ones. I don’t want to replace them, but I also don’t want to be lonely at my new school. What should I do?</p>

<p class="disclaim">Sincerely,<br>
North Meck Abandoner</p>

<p class="disclaim">Dear North Meck Abandoner,</p> 

<p>I understand where you are coming from. I have also moved schools in the past and it is difficult to start over in a new place. Like you said, it can be a struggle to make new friends, but there’s a difference between making new friends and forgetting old ones. There can be a place for multiple people in your heart and new people won’t take away space from old ones.</p>
<p>I would recommend trying to make new friends but also setting aside time for your old ones. One way to make friends at school is to join clubs after school! Some of my best friends are people I have met in activities that I was interested in. Another way is to find people in your classes with similar interests. Talk to the peers around you and maybe compliment some of them!&nbsp;</p>
<p>Try to find new people at school, but also hang out with your North Meck friends. And maybe, sometime introduce the two groups.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="disclaim">Wishing you the best of luck!<br>
Andromeda

<p class="disclaim">Dear Andromeda,</p>

<p>Some of my friends and I are in a class together and we had a group project assigned. They decided to work together but they left me out. I don’t know anyone in the group I’m in now, and it kind of hurts. What do I do?</p>

<p class="disclaim">Sincerely,<br>

<p class="disclaim">Dear Not a Groupie,</p> 

<p>My main advice would be to communicate with your friends. Lack of communication often hurts relationships and bottling up your emotions is not good for you as well. Tell them how you felt left out not being in a group and ask to be in a group for the next project. For the time being try to talk with the people in your group. You never know if any of you will become friends!</p> 

<p class="disclaim">Good luck!<br>
Andromeda

    <h2>High In The Sky: Higher Education For High Schoolers</h2>
    <p id="by">by Kayla "Kal" Wuor <span class="tag opinion">opinion</span></p>
    <div class="article-body">
<p>Welcome to high school. After nine years in elementary and middle school, you've finally made it. You are the big kid you looked up to when growing up. Congratulations on making it this far. I know it has been challenging, and juggling school with your personal life can be tedious, but you did it. You should be proud of yourself.</p>
<p>But what if I told you there's another step? After your government-mandated education, there's another place you need to go.</p>
<p>College.</p>
<p>Schools across the world want their students to pursue higher education. Sure, it's optional, but do you want to succeed? Do you want to get paid more than your peers? Do you want to do something with your life? Then you need to go to college.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As soon as I reached sixth grade, there were lessons discussing college and its benefits. I distinctly remember using a variety of online programs to learn about how those with higher degrees get paid more than others. Now while this may be true, doesn't it seem like propaganda? These lessons would briefly cover other possibilities, but those are "last-resorts." The consensus is that college is the best post-secondary option.</p>
<p>I'm not so sure this is right. We've seen countless individuals who shot into stardom and wealth with nothing more than their high school diplomas. The Kardashians, MrBeast, Addison Rae, Lady Gaga, Steve Jobs, Alicia Keys, Tiger Woods, and Beyonc&eacute;, to name just a few. Thanks to the rise of social media, many have been recognized for a single video. What's the point in acting like college is the only answer?&nbsp;</p>
<p>Many news stories and discussions have involved people with degrees who can't get a job. People sought out the pay benefits associated with a degree, only to find that there wasn't a single job for them. Whether they lack experience or happen to be overqualified, it seems that college isn't the key to success.</p>
<p>But I don't want to jump to any conclusions here. As such, I created two surveys about higher education: one for North Meck students and one for staff members. I want to thank Mrs. Pasko, Dr. Hood, Mrs. Soesbee, and all of the guidance counselors for making the distribution of these surveys possible.</p>
<p>As of January 30, 2023, 110 students and 19 staff members have responded.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Of the student respondents, about three in four plan on attending college, and less than 10% will pursue other pathways. Popular alternatives to a university included trade schools, employment, and intrapersonal improvement.</p>
<p>Twenty respondents (18.2%) are still undecided about what to do after high school. While most will eventually figure it out, some kids will be left behind: nearly a third believe they don't know what they can do after high school, which puts a spotlight on the need for an open discussion on the options we have as students. As I previously mentioned, college shouldn't be the only focus. Even though most respondents had family members or role models who attended college, many thought college was not necessary to prosper in society.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I wish I could mention all the dream occupations that students have, but the reality is that everyone has a different goal. While some did overlap, the originality of North Mecklenburg shines in this survey: from being veterinarians, lawyers, and neurosurgeons to becoming computer scientists, pilots, entrepreneurs, and even being elected president, it's clear that providing a single choice after high school could never encompass the multitude of dreams students have. By conveying the idea that college is the best option after high school, schools are stomping on the goals of so many visionaries.</p>
<p>In the survey designed for staff, teachers were most of the respondents; only four were support staff. Two in three respondents attended college for six years, and only one teacher has an associate degree. Regardless of the level, it's still an impressive accomplishment. About a third of respondents don't know if they will pursue a higher level, which I found surprising. I expected a much lower percentage because I couldn't imagine returning to college (willingly) after you've finished. Nearly half of the staff members don't plan to obtain a higher degree, while 15% will work for one in the future.</p>
<p>For virtually all of these staff members, there was a strong push for higher education from school and family. Indeed, all but one staff member planned to attend college when they were in high school.&nbsp;</p>
<p>But, simultaneously, more than half of teachers believe that students don't have all of the necessary knowledge to decide what to do after their senior year. Only three respondents could confidently agree that students knew their options.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I want to include some comments from our North Mecklenburg staff. I hope this article has helped at least one person understand the different pathways after high school. With enough knowledge, we can all pursue our dreams. (<em>These responses have been edited for clarity.</em>)</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am not convinced that university is the only or best option for people today. I think there are so many trades and other pathways that can lead to a successful and happy adult life. I think high school students need to be informed of their options and shown that we believe in them and that they can choose university or [something else] if that is what they want.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;College is a great experience in addition to its educational value. Take advantage of it if you can. There are plenty of colleges that students do not consider. Think outside the box of the "big name" schools. There are plenty of smaller schools that have a great return on investment and that give scholarship money to students. No matter what, it is going to take some education after high school graduation to work in a job or career that is going to pay enough to be an independent, self-sustainable adult in Charlotte or anywhere else.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don't think college is for everyone and I think students need to hear this message more. I think sometimes there seems to be this expectation that unless you get a college degree, you won't make money or be successful. However, I do agree that having a plan in place before leaving high school is beneficial, or at least knowing what your options are. I think there are certain skills that high school &amp; sometimes higher education can teach a person, but it isn't the only determining factor for success post-graduation.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is always worth the investment to get some education or training after high school. The careers that will support a comfortable lifestyle have changed in the last 30 years. If a four-year degree isn't appealing, then get certified in a trade. The more a person knows, and the more a person can do, then the more possibilities they have for finding fulfilling work. 244 million children around the world don't have access to education. When a student chooses to ignore the opportunities presented -- or find out what opportunities are available to them -- it makes me so sad. So many kids would love our campus and love the chance to keep learning and growing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I believe higher education beyond high school is important, but college is not for everyone. Many other opportunities for education should be emphasized and presented to students as a viable option.&rdquo;</p>
<p><strong>&ldquo;There are many paths to higher education. Students should explore to find the right path for them.&rdquo; </strong>ðŸ†…</p>

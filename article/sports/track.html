    <h2 class="nmbe">A Look Inside Track and Field</h2>

    <p>Many say that all there is to track is running, and they&rsquo;re essentially right. Of course, there&rsquo;s the nonstop exercising, tedious workouts, and dreaded &ldquo;suicides,&rdquo; but in the end, it all comes down to whoever can run the fastest. Whoever can run the longest. Whoever crosses that white line <em>first</em>.</p>
<p>But there&rsquo;s more to Track and Field than just running around in ovals. Hurdles, long and high jump, disk throw, shot put&hellip; all these events require effort and practice. And a consistent amount of it, too. Not to mention, running itself is a lot more complicated than one may realize. How fast you need to go, how long you will run for, and figuring out how to keep your pace and not fall behind. All these factors play a big part in whether you come in first place or fifth.</p>
<p>When it comes to track, there is a lot of conditioning that has to be done. One example of this is &ldquo;suicides,&rdquo; the repeated sprinting from a starting point to each of a series of lines, and back again. It's meant to improve speed and agility and requires lots of effort. That - along with stretches, drills, and mile runs - can put a hefty amount of strain on your body. This is where a healthy diet and lifestyle come into play.</p>
<p>Most sports require a healthy, strong body and a strict diet. For track runners, the aim is to eat a variety of high-quality protein foods. Dairy, eggs, lean beef, poultry, fish, legumes, and beans are all excellent foods. While protein bars, shakes, and smoothies are valuable, they can put athletes at risk of missing key nutrients in their diets.</p>
<p>Jackie Joyner-Kersee is a former track and field Olympic gold medalist who knew how to maintain a good diet, workout routine, and personal life. She is currently 61 and, since retirement, has been working with her very own Youth Center Foundation. She strives to encourage unprivileged youths to play sports in her hometown. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m consistent,&rdquo; she told the Los Angeles Times. &ldquo;I do eat meat and chicken, although I&rsquo;m allergic to seafood. I try to get a lot of fiber, and I eat a lot of fruits and vegetables.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Of course, no one's perfect. Even Joyner-Kersee struggled with eating unhealthy snacks during her competitions: &ldquo;I really try to find a balance &mdash; I don&rsquo;t do everything right either,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;When I was competing, I had a problem with potato chips &mdash; I had to really work with myself. I know I don&rsquo;t benefit if I don&rsquo;t balance diet and nutrition and working out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It takes a lot of work to become proficient at sports (and even more to become great at them), but everyone starts somewhere. High school is where many begin their sports careers, yet 70% of athletes quit before graduating. As of 2023, only 6.3% of male track athletes and 7.5% of females will play in college. With such little opportunity for success, one can only begin to imagine what Olympic athletes went through to be where they are today.</p>
<p>After looking through all the facts and statistics, some might find this all very discouraging. It's not just about maintaining good health while playing but being able to play at all. Several students at North Mecklenburg couldn't try out for track this year because of transportation issues or the strict daily practice schedule. Another factor could be overprotective parents not wanting to risk their children getting hurt while playing a sport.&nbsp;</p>
<p>All these factors present tremendous obstacles that only so many students can overcome. In the end, all one can do is focus on themself, and how they can push themselves to reach their ever-growing goals. Having a good mindset, thinking realistically and logically, and avoiding peer pressure, can all help raise your chances of success. It's up to you to shape your future, and if you want your future to be full of sports trophies and medals, do everything you can to make that future possible. ðŸ†…</p>

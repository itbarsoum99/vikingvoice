    <p id="by" class="nmbs">by Landen Meier <span class="tag spotlight">spotlight</span></p>
    <div class="article-body">
    <p>For anyone who's looking to pursue higher education after high school, a resume for colleges should be one of the first things on your mind. Adding to a list of extracurriculars, classes, activities, and service hours can seem exhausting, especially considering how college applicant pools have never been more selective. These extra bullet points can be a lot of hours, just to jot one sentence of experience down. If only there were a better way!</p>
<p>Introducing Key Club, North Meck&rsquo;s newest volunteer organization. Student-led and community-oriented, Key Club hopes to help North Mecklenburg students improve society (and their resumes) through acts of service.</p>
<p>The great thing about Key Club is that, as an extracurricular, it&rsquo;s probably the single most impactful thing to add to your resume that can be started today. It&rsquo;s an extracurricular, it acts as a class and course in community service, and those classes are tested with service hours. Key Club members will complete 6 mini-projects outside of the club and will participate in large-scale projects outside and inside of the club, like food drives, holiday events, and fundraisers. And unlike other volunteer organizations, Key Club has no requirements for selection.</p>
<p>No matter what career you&rsquo;re looking into, Key Club has something for everyone. Colleges love to see that a student volunteers in the community, can work with a team, and attain self-actualization. In addition, Key Club can provide another perspective for you as a student. Consider becoming a member and getting a letter of recommendation from Mr. Stiefel, who would be happy to talk about your service.</p>
<p>Change can only happen with you! Key Club meets every other Monday in Mr. Stiefel&rsquo;s room. Email Genesis Wood-Brown for more information. ðŸ†…</p>

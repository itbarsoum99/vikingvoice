    <p>This year‚Äôs No Shave November fundraiser at North Mecklenburg High School raised $400 for Loaves and Fishes Food Pantry. Each year, teachers at North Meck abstain from shaving for the month of November before shaving it in silly styles that they wear for the two day week before Thanksgiving Break. The fundraiser collects money in exchange for a chance to vote for which style each teacher should wear. This year, the participants were Mr. Tewers, Mr. Bischoff, Mr. Murray, Mr. Duffy, Mr. Duckworth, Mr. Cook, Mr. Payne, Mr. Hunter, Mr. Maleck, Mr. Dahl, Mr. Becker, Mr. Dull, Mr. Getz, and Mr. Stiefel.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The styles they eventually adopted came from TV shows, movies, or celebrities. An example of the mustaches that were used are from Michael Scott, Dwight Schrute, Wolverine, and Ron Swanson. Some people donated because they wanted to get a laugh out of seeing their teachers with hilarious facial hair, and others donated because they could receive merits. However, anyone who donated should be proud because their one-dollar donation helped someone receive a meal in time for Thanksgiving.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Loaves and Fishes Food Pantry is a non-profit organization in Charlotte. They provide a week's worth of nutritionally balanced meals to families experiencing a short-term crisis. Last year, they provided 106,000 groceries and meals to people who were unable to obtain or prepare something to eat. Half of the people this helped were children or seniors. The organization recently merged with Friendship Trays to expand their cause for fighting hunger. Friendship Trays delivers meals to the elderly while providing the human connection that comes from the delivery. This non-profit started way back in 1975 when a small group of volunteers opened an emergency food pantry at a church in Mecklenburg County. That small pantry feeds 1,000 people and counting. The great thing about this is they not only provide meals but also groceries, so people can make their meals at home. This non-profit started in North Carolina and has now expanded across the eastern half of the country.</p>
<p>No Shave November has its origins in Chicago. It got its start in 2009 when a family in Chicago used this trend to raise money for cancer charities in honor of their father who passed away from colon cancer. Part of their mission was for people to embrace the hair they are growing since many lose it when undergoing cancer treatments. This family-founded organization created a worldwide phenomenon and helped raise over 12 million dollars. Also, more than 5 million people have been participating in this trend since it started.&nbsp;</p>
<p>What some people don't know is No Shave November has a sister trend, Movember. This started far from the United States. In Australia, two ‚Äúmates‚Äù started a trend to encourage men's health and protection from cancer. Now, it has spread all over the world and helps raise money for all kinds of charities. There is only one rule for No Shave November: don't shave! This trend is very popular with men because it focuses on growing out facial hair but people of any gender can participate. By forgoing haircuts or growing leg hair, there are so many ways to raise awareness. This global organization focuses on men's health initiatives by addressing everything like mental health, suicide prevention, and prostate cancer.</p>
<p>Initially, this trend started as a way to raise money for a multitude of cancer charities. Now, it has spread, and people use it as a way to raise money for anything. The great thing about this is you can easily start it with your friends and family. By starting a No Shave November fundraiser you can create a fun way to raise awareness for any charity of your choice. üÜÖ</p>

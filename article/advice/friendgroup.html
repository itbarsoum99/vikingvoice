<p class="disclaim">Dear Andromeda,</p>

<p>I had a large group of friends, but after we both went to different schools and they began verbally abusing me, I left. I'm upset about this fact because I enjoyed our time together but feel satisfied because now I'm not insulted. They are trying to get me to come back, and keep on hassling me about it, and I'm worried about what will happen if they reach their limits.

<p class="disclaim">Dear Guy With Heartaches by the Number,</p> 
<p>If you feel uncomfortable in this situation it is not worth it. You do not need to stay in a relationship or situation that is toxic. I personally think it would be best to completely cut ties with them. It might be hard to do but if you think it would be helpful, than it may benefit you in the long run. I have two suggestions for how you could do this. The first is to block them. Unfollow them from social media, block their numbers, block their accounts, and avoid them if you ever see them in person. The second: before you block them, try to communicate with them one last time. If you were to try this, explain to them that they hurt you and you do not want to remain in contact with them. Then you can block them if they continue to bother you.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Proceed with caution because whatever you do, your safety comes first. If anything seems dangerous tell a trusted adult or an authority figure. You should not be in danger because of their bad decisions.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="disclaim">Wishing you the best of luck!<br>
Andromeda

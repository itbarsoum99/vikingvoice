    <p>The North Mecklenburg Women's Volleyball team is undergoing its best season in ten years. The team has a record of 12-7 (as of writing), with wins against competitive schools such as Hopewell and South Mecklenburg. The win rate was 63% with only three more games to go in the season; this is on par to be the season with the highest win rate since 2011-12.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The team has seen standout performances from players of all ages, such as Olivia Stevens and Cydney Moore, who were both nominated for Charlotte Observer Women's Athlete of the Week. Olivia Stevens also ranks among the top players in the Charlotte district and averages an impressive 2.7 kills per set. Other standout players include Sydney Bess, who averages a total of 0.9 aces per set with a total of 51 aces throughout the season, and Tatiana Soriano, with an average of 3.4 digs per set and the highest number of receptions for the team, 229.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Now, the team prepares to finish off its season with a final game against their rival, senior night, and playoffs. No matter what happens in these final games, this team has cemented itself into North Meck Volleyball's success, and all players and coaches should be ecstatic about how this season has turned out. North Meck wishes them luck in their final few games and then onto playoffs, where they will face tough competition such as Hough and Mallard Creek. ðŸ†…</p>

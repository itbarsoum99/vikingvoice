    <p><strong>Session One: November 3rd, 20XX</strong></p>
<p>I need therapy.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not that good mentally, I can admit that to myself.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m quite an anxious lass, to be honest.</p>
<p>Ever since my mother passed, it&rsquo;s been hard to cope with the feelings.</p>
<p>These vicious demons, crawling up my spine.</p>
<p>Taking every part of my consciousness away.</p>
<p>Taking control of my body and my mind.</p>
<p>Making me do these things.</p>
<p>These oh so quite irrational things.</p>
<p>That I would never do myself.</p>
<p>I can do nothing but watch as my mind betrays me.</p>
<p>As my beautiful body causes nothing but destruction</p>
<p>And nothing but terror around me.</p>
<p>For a woman named Mrs. Blossom, she is anything but beautiful.</p>
<p>Hagrid face, hagrid personality.</p>
<p>Her eyes are bloodshot and her fingernails look moldy.</p>
<p>Yes, moldy. Like months-old bread.</p>
<p>I wouldn&rsquo;t be surprised if she made my anxiety worse.</p>
<p>Her lackluster attempt at helping is pissing me off.</p>
<p>She&rsquo;s a horrible excuse for a therapist.</p>
<p>I truly don&rsquo;t understand how she got her job.</p>
<p><span style="color: #980000;">I wouldn&rsquo;t feel guilty if she lost her job.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #980000;">Or if she lost everything she loved.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #980000;">Nor would I feel bad if she just croaked right here.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #980000;">I wouldn&rsquo;t feel guilty if I just kil-</span></p>
<p>Yes I would! Yes I would!</p>
<p>Happy thoughts, happy thoughts.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not going to think negatively.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not dealing with that again!</p>
<p>Let me give her another chance!</p>
<p>Everyone deserves a second chance!</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll come back next week.</p>
<p><strong>Session Two: November 10th, 20XX</strong></p>
<p>I was right, as per usual.</p>
<p>Truly upsetting, but I guess that&rsquo;s how life works.</p>
<p>This heathen did not deserve a second chance.</p>
<p>If I&rsquo;m being honest, she didn&rsquo;t deserve any chances.</p>
<p>But here I was trying to be kind, trying to be hopeful.</p>
<p>But, once again, she&rsquo;s indifferent to my emotions.</p>
<p>She&rsquo;s only here to receive her next check.</p>
<p>She doesn&rsquo;t care. She doesn&rsquo;t care.</p>
<p>She doesn&rsquo;t care at all.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t care either.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll let her keep talking.</p>
<p>Wasting her breath with every word.</p>
<p>She can act like she knows me all she wants.</p>
<p>Like she knows what I&rsquo;ve been through.</p>
<p>Like she knows the pain I dealt with.</p>
<p>Like she was there watching my innocence die.</p>
<p>But she doesn&rsquo;t know me.</p>
<p><span style="color: #980000;"><em>But I know her.</em></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #980000;"><em>I know so much about her.</em></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #980000;"><em>I know that she leaves here at 8pm.</em></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #980000;"><em>She leaves in a gray coupe with 2 bumper stickers.</em></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #980000;"><em>I know that her license plate is U8FX3R.</em></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #980000;"><em>I know that she gets home around 9pm.</em></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #980000;"><em>I know that she&rsquo;s greeted by her daughter.</em></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #980000;"><em>Her sweet, 8 year old daughter.</em></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #980000;"><em>Her daughter that means the world to her.</em></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #980000;"><em>Her daughter that she does everything for.</em></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #980000;"><em>And I know that she&rsquo;s gonna need therapy just as much as me,</em></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #980000;"><em>If something happened to her.</em></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #980000;"><em>I know her life would crumble if she found her little girl dead.</em></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #980000;"><em>Suffocated by the stuffed animals in her bed.</em></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #980000;"><em>Her blue face frozen with a look of fear.</em></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #980000;"><em>Fighting for her life to no avail.</em></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #980000;"><em>It would be a shame.</em></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #980000;"><em>It would be such a shame.</em></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #980000;"><em>Sure hope that doesn&rsquo;t happen.</em></span></p>

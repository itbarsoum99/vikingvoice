<p class="disclaim">Dear Andromeda,</p>

<p>I just left my old friend group because they were too coupled up and would leave me out of conversations. Even people who weren't in a relationship seemed to be buddied up and would stop talking if the other person came around. I don't even think that they noticed that I basically ghosted them. They really only talk to me when they need work. I would sit with them at lunch and feel like I was sitting alone. Should I tell them how I feel and hope they change or should I just say away?</p>

<p class="disclaim">Sincerely,<br>
The Single Friend</p>

<p class="disclaim">Dear Single Friend,</p> 

<p>I understand how it feels to be left out, and it&rsquo;s hard to figure out who is genuinely your friend. I think the best course of action depends on what you think their motives are. If you think they are intentionally leaving you out/not actually your friends, then I wouldn&rsquo;t feel bad about leaving them. If they want to try to be your friend again, then they can put in the effort this time. (Don&rsquo;t feel pressured to forgive them if this happens, though.)&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you do think that they were your friends, and they unintentionally made you feel bad, I would try to communicate with them. They might not have noticed that they were making you feel left out, and this could help them be better friends in the future.&nbsp;</p>
<p>All in all, the decision is up to you. You get to decide how you would like to spend your time, so don&rsquo;t spend it on people who make you feel bad. Even if they were not intentionally making you feel bad, I would recommend finding other friends who don&rsquo;t make you feel lonely when you&rsquo;re with them. Find people you want to hang out with and genuinely enjoy your presence.&nbsp;</p>

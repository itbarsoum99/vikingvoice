<p>So pretty.<br/>
The girl of my dreams.<br/>
Her face was carved from the angels.<br/>
Every little imperfection only added to her charm.<br/>
From top to bottom, she’s a goddess.<br/>
She looks at me in a way nobody else does.<br/>
Her piercing gaze, her pearly teeth visible inside her seductive lips.<br/>
Evoked an indescribable feeling within me<br/>
I’m in love.</p>

<p>She walked alongside me today.<br>
So stiff, walking like a statue would.<br>
She must feel the same way I do.<br>
So hard to breathe. So intoxicating.<br>
I want to touch her. I want to feel her.<br>
I want her arms wrapped around me.<br>
I want her in a way nobody else could.<br>
And I know she feels the same way.<br>
She will feel the same way.</p>

<p>I saw her today. She was talking to a guy.<br/>
Who is he? What is he doing with my betrothed?<br/>
A friend? A brother? A lover?<br>
Why is she with him? She’s mine.<br>
Why are they laughing? She shouldn’t be happy with anyone else.<br>
She’s my woman. She can’t have anyone else.</p>

<p>I had to follow her.<br/>
It’s the only way I could save her.<br>
She was walking with the guy late at night.<br>
I know he’s bad for her.<br>
He’s gonna hurt her.<br>
I would never hurt her. I love her.<br>
I know she loves me. She doesn’t love anyone but me.<br>
He’s gone.<br>
He took her home and left.<br>
I’m so happy he left.<br>
I followed him to a club. Of course he would go there.<br>
A guy like him only cares about the body of a woman.<br>
I cornered him against a wall. He thought I was crazy.<br>
I’m not crazy. He’s the crazy one here.<br>
I stabbed him in the gut.<br>
He sobbed out as he perished.<br>
How dare he cry? He doesn’t deserve to cry.<br>
My love should be crying. She’s crying right now.<br>
I need to comfort her. I need to be with her.</p>

<p>It’s a new day. I’m antsy.<br>
I haven’t seen my love in so long.<br>
It’s been too many hours for me to feel okay without her.<br>
She was in the library, where she goes every Tuesday at exactly 5:07pm.<br>
I must know her schedule. She loves it when I know her schedule.<br>
She’s crying. She misses me.<br>
She’s hugging herself, silent choked sobs.<br>
I know she misses me. She only misses me.<br>
She has a friend comforting her.<br>
She’s saying that his murder was senseless.<br>
Whose murder? The creep who followed her around?<br>
His murder has a purpose! He was going to hurt her!<br>
She’s trying to distort her mind. I need to save my baby.<br>
She needs to go too.</p>

<p>Girls are easier to get. They’re weaker; can’t fight back.<br>
I hate it when they fight back.<br>
She begged for her life in the dark alleyway.<br>
As if a criminal like her deserved life.<br>
She tried to harm my wife too. She was dangerous.<br>
I cleaned my hands, stained with the blood of a criminal.<br>
I miss my betrothed.</p>  

<p>I visited her house. I missed her too much to wait.<br>
She’s bathing her body under the dim light in her bathroom.<br>
Her silhouette was visible, even with the curtain separating her from me.<br>
Even with the window separating her from me, I can still smell her.<br>
She’s stepping out, her body fully on display.<br>
I had to move a little so she wouldn’t see me.<br>
I know her face would turn red if she saw me.<br>
Her blush would be too strong to hide.<br>
I wish I was in there with her.<br>
Feeling her velvety skin across my fingertips.<br>
I have to get in there.<br>
I know she wants me.<br>
Just as much as I want her.<br>
We will be together.</p>

<p>She has cheated on me.<br>
I saw her kiss another man today.<br>
With a smile on her face, embracing that stranger.<br>
I heard her say she loves him.<br>
She can’t love him. She must only love me.<br>
I must punish her for this. She’s betrayed my trust.<br>
He must go too. He’s ruining our relationship.<br>
She’s all mine. Only mine.</p>

<p>She brought him to her house for a date.<br>
Her heavenly domain has been infected with a plague.<br>
I must disinfect her.<br>
His hands are ruining her pureness.<br>
I must get in. I can’t let him do this.<br>
She left her door unlocked. She wanted me to save her.<br>
He must’ve forced her to be with him.<br>
My baby would never betray me. She loves me.<br>
I snuck up behind them. They were watching a movie in her living room.<br>
He had his arm around her shoulder. Trapping her.<br>
I moved quietly, wrapping my wire around his neck.<br>
I moved perfectly, making sure that he couldn’t make a sound.<br>
I sat with them for some time until it was just her and I alive.<br>
She’s such a pretty doll, her eyes never moving from the screen.<br>
So she didn’t notice when his arm moved away from her body.<br>
She didn’t notice when the sofa got lighter.<br>
And she didn’t notice when I wrapped my arms around her.<br>
She said his name as she snuggled in next to me.<br>
She didn’t know that I had saved her.<br>
I didn’t correct her at first. I wanted to savor this moment.<br>
Finally, our first interaction (outside of the glances she gave me).<br>
Her breath synced with mine as we sat.<br>
Up close, I could see how her eyelashes fluttered when she was tired.<br>
How her warm body felt against mine.<br>
How her angelic voice would create the most amazing yawns.</p>

<p>But I had to ruin the silence. She had to know that she was safe.<br>
I whispered my name into her ear.<br>
She sat up and stared at me with wide eyes.<br>
She looked like a deer in headlights. Why would she look at me like that?<br>
I tried to grab her in for a kiss, but she slapped me. How dare she slap me?<br>
She cried for the man’s name but saw his corpse on the ground and screamed.<br>
I tried to comfort her, but she called me crazy.</p>

<p>Me? Crazy?! This woman is out of her mind.<br>
I have done nothing but love her unconditionally.<br>
I sacrificed all of my time for her.<br>
My whole existence surrounds her.<br>
I do everything for her. I would do anything for her.<br>
I got rid of 3 people for her.<br>
She’s so ungrateful. So unloving.<br>
Why did I ever love her?<br>
I’ve wasted so much time with this ungrateful woman.<br>
Enraged, I threw the vase that her father gifted her for her 23rd birthday.</p>

<p>It shattered against her head. She fell to the ground.<br>
Bleeding out on the ground, she started crying out names.<br>
Her parents, her friends, her lovers.<br>
She wouldn’t say my name. So heartless.<br>
I still decided to give her one kiss before she departed this world.<br>
I cradled her body, her sweet blood soaking my shirt.<br>
Her warmth slowly escaped her body, radiating mine.<br>
Her angelic scent still filled the room.<br>
I finally get to feel all of her. I get to touch her in a way nobody else can.<br>
Her limp body moves with mine as if we’re soulmates.<br>
We are soulmates. She is my betrothed.<br>
As the sirens got closer, I gave her one last kiss.<br>
Feeling her cold lips against mine felt so good.<br>
As the men in blue uniforms yanked me away from her, I got one last look at her.<br>
My baby, my lover, my betrothed. Mine.</p>
